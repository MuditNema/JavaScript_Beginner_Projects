In this project , I used javascript - regex (regular expressions) to validate a form .
It allows the submission of form only when all the conditions are met like name should have alphabets only , password must be a combination of uppercase , lowercase , numbers and symbols and things like that.It's completely responsive also.
Any suggestions are much appreciated.
